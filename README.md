# Project Name: 
	El Halso
	El Halso is a group project developed by:
	Mohammad Abu Ali
	Abdalrahman Khroubi
	Fouad Taha
	EL Halso serves as a bridge connection between clients seeking services, and businesses providing them.
    It has 2 sides, one for businesses, and one for clients.
    The business side offers the users the option to manage the outlook of their business. By providing them the option to add a description, logo and a gallery of photos for their business. It also provides them the reviews and feedback which the clients have given. Which would help businesses improve and stay connected to the population they seek to serve.
    
    The client side offers the clients a search-tool for the services they seek within a distance which they regard as suitable. EL Halso, provides the client of a myriad of categories which fits what the client is searching for. Then after choosing the category, EL Halso shows all the businesses which fits that category within the distance the client desires. While also showing him the businesses he regarded as excellent and have added to his favorites list.
    After picking the business, a page will open showing the client what information the business chose to present. Including a description of the business, the logo as well as the pictures the business has uploaded. In addition to that, the client can see the reviews given to the business, as well as provide his own review. The client has the option to add the business to his favorite list. Then, the user can use Wazeâ„¢ to travel to the business.
    
    If the user changes his mind about the distance, whether he wants to increase or decrease the area of search, he can do that easily from the settings menu, which in addition to manipulating the distance, also provides him the option to remove a place he previously chose as one of his favorites.
    
    The user can switch accounts between the business side and the client side, by clicking on the logo in the login menu.
